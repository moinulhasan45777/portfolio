# Contact Form - Formspree Integration

The contact form is now configured with your personal Formspree account.

## Current Configuration

- **Formspree Endpoint**: `https://formspree.io/f/mqeajlqe`
- **Destination Email**: `moinul.hasan45777@gmail.com`
- **Fallback**: mailto links if Formspree fails

## How It Works

1. **User fills out contact form** → clicks "Send Message"
2. **Formspree processes the submission** → sends email to your inbox
3. **You receive email notification** at moinul.hasan45777@gmail.com
4. **User sees success confirmation** → form resets automatically

## Email Content

You'll receive emails with:

- **From**: The sender's name and email
